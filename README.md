The project is to detect fight from real time camera streaming at workplace and generating alerts to admins when violation is detected.
model built is mobilenetv2 model
there are two testing files:
1. violence detection testing
2. non violence detection testing

model and non violence files are uploaded but violence testing and alert generation files are larger in size so drive links are attached:
